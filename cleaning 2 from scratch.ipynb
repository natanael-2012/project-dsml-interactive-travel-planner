These projects, which have already been approved by the Senate, aim to establish the salary for insular officials and amend the Nationality Law of 1940 to ensure that a group of Puerto Ricans does not lose their American citizenship. The action is expected to lead to approval before the recess scheduled for June 10. The approval of these measures has been interpreted in insular circles as an example of the quick action by the committees of both chambers dealing with the projects introduced this year. The Butler project authorizes the legislature to set the salaries of insular officials, excluding the Supreme Court judges. It establishes an annual salary of $10,000 for the Federal Agency Coordinator, which is an increase from the previously set amount. The legislature will have the authority to increase the salaries of its members, provided that this increase does not take effect for the term for which they were elected. The project by Senator Cordon excludes from the scope of the Nationality Law of 1940 Puerto Ricans born before April 11, 1899, restoring citizenship to those who may have lost it.

In 1913, the 'Union of Puerto Rico' party included 'Independence' as a goal, with leaders Luis Muñoz Rivera and José de Diego adopting the same flag as that of the New York Club for their aspiration. Therefore, this flag symbolizes a national aspiration, a dream that José de Diego died pursuing. Muñoz Rivera, while residing in Washington, believed it prudent to return to the 'State' solution as a counterbalance to 'Independence', leaving Congress with the responsibility for any actions.
