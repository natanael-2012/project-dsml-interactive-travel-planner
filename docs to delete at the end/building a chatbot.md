# Building a Chatbot
Building a chatbot that integrates the functions you mentioned, including location ranking, weather retrieval, and other features, can be done in several steps. Let me walk you through the general architecture and how you can integrate the functions in the chatbot flow.

### Overview of the Steps

1. **Chatbot Setup**:
   - Decide on a chatbot framework or platform (e.g., OpenAI API, Rasa, BotPress, etc.).
   - Use natural language understanding (NLU) to understand user prompts and intents.
   - Use the functions (e.g., `find_weather_forecast`, `rank_appropriate_locations`) to generate appropriate responses based on user input.

2. **Core Functions**:
   - You already have some core functions like `find_weather_forecast`, `rank_appropriate_locations`, etc. Each of these will be called based on what the user asks.

3. **Conversation Flow**:
   - Based on user prompts, identify what the user is asking for (e.g., asking for weather, places to visit, etc.).
   - Call the relevant functions based on the conversation flow and return the response.

Let’s break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Chatbot Architecture

Since you're already working with models like GPT-4o-mini and FLAN-T5, we'll build this chatbot around the logic of processing user input, generating a response, and calling your specific functions based on the conversation context.

You can use a framework or a simple API-based architecture. For simplicity, let’s consider the following architecture:

- **User Input**: The user sends a message (e.g., "What are the best places to visit in Puerto Rico?").
- **Intent Recognition**: The bot detects whether the user is asking for a recommendation, weather forecast, etc.
- **Call Function**: Based on the intent, the bot calls the relevant function (e.g., `rank_appropriate_locations`) and generates the response.
- **Response**: The bot sends back the information or performs an action.

---

### Step 2: Intent Recognition & NLP Processing

We need to recognize what the user wants. You can use a lightweight method like keyword matching or a more advanced method like **intent detection** using a pre-trained NLP model.

For example, using GPT-4o-mini or FLAN-T5 to understand the intent:
- If the user says "What’s the weather in San Juan tomorrow?" → Call the `find_weather_forecast` function.
- If the user says "What are some good sunny places to visit?" → Call the `rank_appropriate_locations` function.

#### Sample Code for Intent Recognition

```python
def get_intent(prompt):
    """
    Very basic intent recognition based on user input.
    This can be replaced with more sophisticated NLP-based classification.
    """
    if "weather" in prompt.lower():
        return "weather_forecast"
    elif "visit" in prompt.lower() or "places" in prompt.lower():
        return "location_recommendation"
    elif "information" in prompt.lower() or "tell me about" in prompt.lower():
        return "location_info"
    else:
        return "general_chat"

# Example usage
user_prompt = "What are the best sunny places to visit?"
intent = get_intent(user_prompt)
print(intent)  # Output: location_recommendation
```

This function can be expanded using **NLU models** like BERT for better intent classification, but keyword matching works for simple cases.

### Step 3: Defining the Functions

#### 1. **Find Weather Forecast**

```python
def find_weather_forecast(date, location):
    # Call OpenWeather API here using requests
    weather_data = "Sunny with a high of 85°F"  # Placeholder response
    return f"The weather in {location} on {date} is {weather_data}."
```

#### 2. **Rank Appropriate Locations**

We already discussed the ranking of locations. Here’s how you integrate it:

```python
def rank_appropriate_locations(user_prompt):
    # Extract preferences using the zero-shot classifier
    preferences = extract_preferences(user_prompt)
    
    # Query ChromaDB for matching locations (based on landmarks, municipalities)
    # You can integrate the ChromaDB search here to match the preferences with locations
    matching_locations = ["San Juan Beach", "Old San Juan", "Ponce Museum"]  # Placeholder

    # Return ranked locations
    return f"Based on your preferences, here are some places to visit: {', '.join(matching_locations)}"
```

#### 3. **Find Info on a Location**

```python
def find_info_on_location(user_prompt, location):
    # You would use the ChromaDB or RAG system to retrieve relevant information
    location_info = "Old San Juan is known for its rich history and beautiful architecture."  # Placeholder
    return location_info
```

#### 4. **Adding a Location to the Visit List**

```python
def add_location_to_visit_list(visit_list, location):
    if location not in visit_list:
        visit_list.append(location)
    return visit_list
```

#### 5. **Compute Distance Between Locations**

```python
def compute_distance_to_list(visit_list, new_location):
    # You could integrate a map API or simple distance calculation here
    closest_location = "Old San Juan"  # Placeholder for closest location logic
    return f"The distance from {closest_location} to {new_location} is 5 miles."
```

---

### Step 4: Building the Chatbot Conversation Flow

We can build the chatbot's conversation flow using the recognized intents and call the functions accordingly. Here’s a basic example:

```python
def chatbot(user_prompt, visit_list):
    intent = get_intent(user_prompt)

    if intent == "weather_forecast":
        # Extract the date and location from the prompt
        return find_weather_forecast("tomorrow", "San Juan")

    elif intent == "location_recommendation":
        # Use the rank_appropriate_locations function
        return rank_appropriate_locations(user_prompt)

    elif intent == "location_info":
        # Extract location and find info
        return find_info_on_location(user_prompt, "Old San Juan")

    elif intent == "add_location":
        # Add a location to visit list
        return add_location_to_visit_list(visit_list, "San Juan Beach")

    else:
        return "I'm not sure how to help with that. Can you ask me about the weather or places to visit?"
```

### Step 5: Putting It Together

Now that the chatbot is calling the functions based on the user's intent, you can expand the logic to interact with APIs, fetch dynamic content (e.g., weather data), and use ChromaDB for relevant location retrieval.

Here’s an example conversation flow:

- **User**: "What's the weather in San Juan tomorrow?"
- **Bot**: Calls `find_weather_forecast` → "The weather in San Juan tomorrow is sunny with a high of 85°F."

- **User**: "What are some good sunny places to visit?"
- **Bot**: Calls `rank_appropriate_locations` → "Based on your preferences, here are some places to visit: San Juan Beach, Ponce Museum, Old San Juan."

---

This setup builds a functional chatbot that can take user prompts, recognize intents, and call the appropriate functions dynamically. You can further improve by adding more complex NLP models for intent recognition, preference extraction, and integrating APIs for dynamic data retrieval.

# Chatbot Flow summary

To make GPT-4o-mini call your custom functions (like `find_weather_forecast` or `rank_appropriate_locations`), you need to **handle the logic** around the chatbot so that **before sending the user's prompt to the GPT model**, the system detects **whether it’s a function call** or should be treated as a conversational response. Here's how the flow would work:

### Approach:

1. **User Prompt Handling**:
   You first handle the user's input (the prompt) to check if it's a command that maps to a function (e.g., asking about weather, places to visit, or distances).

2. **Function Call Interception**:
   If the user prompt requires calling a function (e.g., getting weather data, finding locations), you process it before calling the GPT model. You perform the function call, get the result, and then decide whether to pass the result directly or rephrase it through GPT.

3. **Fallback to GPT Model**:
   If the user’s request is a general question or conversation (e.g., "Tell me something interesting"), you pass the prompt to GPT-4o-mini to generate a response.

### Steps to Implement This:

#### 1. **Check if the User Prompt Maps to a Function Call**

You'll need to preprocess the user prompt and decide whether it triggers one of your custom functions. For example, if the user says "What’s the weather in San Juan tomorrow?", you intercept this and call the `find_weather_forecast` function.

#### 2. **Function Calling Logic**

Here's how you can modify the flow to check if a function should be called before passing the prompt to GPT:

```python
def process_user_prompt(user_prompt, visit_list):
    """
    Processes the user prompt to check if it matches an intent requiring a function call.
    If it does, it calls the function directly. Otherwise, it sends the prompt to GPT.
    """
    # Determine the intent (weather, location recommendation, etc.)
    intent = get_intent(user_prompt)  # Use your intent recognition logic here

    if intent == "weather_forecast":
        # Extract details (you can improve this with more NLP parsing)
        location = "San Juan"  # Hardcoded for simplicity, extract from prompt dynamically
        date = "tomorrow"  # Similarly, extract the date
        return find_weather_forecast(date, location)

    elif intent == "location_recommendation":
        # Call location ranking function
        return rank_appropriate_locations(user_prompt)

    elif intent == "location_info":
        # Get information on the location
        return find_info_on_location(user_prompt, "Old San Juan")

    elif intent == "add_location":
        # Add location to visit list
        return add_location_to_visit_list(visit_list, "San Juan Beach")

    # If none of the intents match, fallback to using GPT
    return None  # This indicates we will call GPT-4o-mini
```

#### 3. **Integrating with GPT-4o-mini**

In the chatbot flow, after checking if the function should be called, you handle the GPT model call only if no function was triggered:

```python
def chatbot(user_prompt, visit_list, temperature=0.7, max_completion_tokens=150, **kwargs):
    # Check if the user prompt triggers a function call
    function_response = process_user_prompt(user_prompt, visit_list)

    if function_response is not None:
        # If a function was called, return the result of that function
        return function_response
    else:
        # Otherwise, fallback to GPT model
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4o-mini",
            messages=[
                {
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": user_prompt
                }
            ],
            temperature=temperature,
            max_completion_tokens=max_completion_tokens,
            **kwargs
        )
        return response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
```


### Flow Summary

1. **Intercept User Input**:
   - You check if the user's input requires calling one of your custom functions (e.g., weather, location recommendation).
   
2. **Call Custom Functions**:
   - If it matches an intent (e.g., `find_weather_forecast`, `rank_appropriate_locations`), call the function directly and return the result to the user without sending it to GPT.

3. **Fallback to GPT-4o-mini**:
   - If the input doesn’t map to any specific function (just a conversational prompt or unknown query), send the prompt to GPT-4o-mini for response generation.

### Example Flow:

- **User**: "What’s the weather in San Juan tomorrow?"
- **Bot**:
  - The `process_user_prompt` function recognizes that this is a weather query.
  - Calls `find_weather_forecast("tomorrow", "San Juan")` and returns the result: **"The weather in San Juan tomorrow is sunny with a high of 85°F."**
  
- **User**: "Tell me a fun fact!"
- **Bot**:
  - No specific function to handle this query.
  - Falls back to GPT-4o-mini to generate a conversational response: **"Did you know that honey never spoils? Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible!"**

### General Considerations

1. **NLP Parsing**:
   For functions like `find_weather_forecast`, it’s important to extract the `date` and `location` from the prompt. You can use more advanced NLP techniques to parse these inputs (using regex, Spacy, or transformers for entity recognition).

2. **User Feedback**:
   If the bot cannot find the intent or fails to call a function, you can always ask the user for clarification or fallback to GPT to handle the conversation smoothly.

3. **Function Integration**:
   You can easily extend this approach with more functions. The key is to detect the user's intent early, call the necessary function if possible, and handle everything else through GPT.
